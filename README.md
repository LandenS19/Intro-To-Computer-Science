# Intro-To-Computer-Science
A few short programs I made during the Intro to Computer Science Course.
Main use is for easy access to all my project files and for easy sharing. This repository contains almost all the files I made for the class. 
Some of the files contain images that are only visible if the file is downloaded and opened using Dr. Racket.
